The second image that I chose was one of the last photos we took. I particularly enjoy this photo not because it was of myself but because it looks pretty good. I believe that the fstop and the shutter speed should have been adjusted a bit better due to my hand being a bit blurred and the image overall being darker than I would like. In photoshop, this image was adjusted to 5” x 7”. The tone was adjusted by applying different layers of filters which brightened the image and lightened the image using cooler tones.
