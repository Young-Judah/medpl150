My work explores my inner child, and I hope it helps others reconnect with theirs through the comforting art of crochet. I’m drawn to soft, playful features like pink, bows, and hearts. I often question whether I am fully representing myself in my work because I am still figuring out who I love to be, and that growth shows in what I create and share.
<br>
I post my art in a way that feels both calculated and carefree, creating calm, relatable, silly, and high-quality content. I use recognizable symbols like hearts, animals, and crosses to connect with a like-minded community. Crochet is my main medium, but I also write poetry and hope to explore short stories. I am always evolving, and for me, crocheting is a way to quiet the noise of the world.
