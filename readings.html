  <h1>Nevaeh Rochford's Reflection ♡</h1>
  <p>
"As an emerging crochet artist, I think about representing the world at this moment through images in a very personal and practical way. I am actively learning how photography does not simply document my work, but shapes how it is understood, valued, and desired. When I take photos of my crochet pieces, I am not only showing what they look like, but creating a version of reality that influences how people emotionally connect to my brand and whether they feel compelled to purchase my work.
Our world today feels visually oversaturated, especially through social media, where images are constantly consumed, shared, and judged within seconds. Photography plays a major role in this environment by turning objects into symbols. A crochet plush is no longer just a handmade item; through lighting, framing, and composition, it can represent comfort, nostalgia, playfulness, or care. I experience this firsthand when I notice that the same product can feel completely different depending on how it is photographed. The image often becomes more powerful than the object itself, shaping expectations before the item is ever physically touched.
<br>
Illustration and intentional visual styling allow me to communicate emotion in ways that straightforward documentation cannot. By choosing soft colors, playful arrangements, and warm backgrounds, I can express the values of my brand, which center around comfort, childhood joy, and emotional safety. These visual choices reflect the broader world we live in now, where people often seek softness and connection as a response to fast-paced, digitally mediated lives. Illustration and stylization make it possible to express feelings that are difficult to capture directly, turning handmade objects into emotional experiences rather than just products.
<br>
The combination of image and text is especially significant in how I understand visual culture today. On platforms like Instagram, images rarely exist on their own. Captions, emojis, and short written reflections influence how viewers interpret what they see. I have learned that people respond more deeply when images of my crochet work are paired with personal explanations or emotional context rather than purely promotional language. This reflects how meaning is constructed in our current moment, where images rely on surrounding narratives to guide understanding.
<br>
Through my own practice, I am becoming increasingly aware that photography and illustration are tools of influence as much as representation. This idea closely connects to Susan Sontag’s discussion in In Plato’s Cave, where she explains that photographs do not simply reflect reality, but shape how reality is perceived. Images can distance us from direct experience while simultaneously becoming substitutes for it. In my work, the photograph often becomes the primary way people encounter my crochet pieces, especially online. The image stands in for the physical object, shaping desire, emotion, and meaning before any real interaction occurs.
As I continue developing my practice, I am also learning that the technical aspects of photography, such as lighting, camera settings, and angles, are just as important as artistic intention. Understanding how light softens textures or how different lenses change perspective is an ever-evolving process for me. This learning experience constantly reshapes how I present my work and how my brand is visually understood. Rather than feeling limited, this ongoing experimentation excites me. It allows me to grow not only as a crochet artist, but as a visual storyteller who understands the power images hold in shaping perception. In a world increasingly mediated through photographs, learning how to intentionally create images feels both necessary and deeply meaningful to my artistic journey."
