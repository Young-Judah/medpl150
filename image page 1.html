The first image I chose was one of the very first pictures me and my partner took. I thought this image to be one of the best images out of the many photos we took around the school. We took this image on the third floor bridge looking out towards uptown I believe which always looks very interesting any time of the day due to the traffic. This image was adjusted to the size 1920 x 1080 px
